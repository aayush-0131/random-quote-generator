# Random Quote Generator

A simple, clean, and responsive web application that displays a random inspirational quote. With the click of a button, users can fetch and display a new quote.

This project is a great introductory exercise for using third-party APIs with JavaScript's `fetch` method.

## Features

-   **Displays a Random Quote:** Loads an initial quote upon page load.
-   **Fetch New Quotes:** A dedicated button to fetch a new random quote from the API.
-   **Clean UI:** Minimalist design that puts the focus on the quote itself.
-   **Responsive:** Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

-   **HTML:** For the basic structure and content.
-   **CSS:** For styling and layout.
-   **JavaScript:** For fetching data from the API and manipulating the DOM.
-   **API:** [Quotable.io](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) (free and requires no API key).
